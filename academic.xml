<section><title> Why is Erlang called "Erlang"?</title>
<p>

	Erlang is named after the mathematician Agner Erlang. Among other
	things, he worked on queueing theory. The original implementors
	also tend to avoid denying that Erlang sounds a little like
	"ERicsson LANGuage".

</p></section>
<section><title>Who invented Erlang?</title>
<p>
	During the 1980s there was a project at the Ericsson 
	<url href="http://www.cs-lab.org/"> 
	Computer Science Laboratory</url>
	which aimed to find out what aspects of computer languages 
	made it easier to program telecommunications systems. Erlang 
	emerged in the second half of the 80s was the result of 
	taking those features which made writing such systems 
	simpler and avoiding those which made them more complex 
	or error prone.
	</p><p>

	The people involved at the start were Joe Armstrong,
	Robert Virding and Mike Williams. Others joined later 
	and added things like distribution and OTP.

</p></section>
<section><title>Where does Erlang syntax come from?</title>
<p>

	Mostly from prolog. Erlang started life as a modified prolog.
	! as the send-message operator comes from CSP. Eripascal
	was probably responsible for , and ; being separators and
	not terminators.

</p></section>
<section><title>Why is Ericsson giving away Erlang?</title>
<p>
	(The following is my personal impression. I don't speak
	for Ericsson!)
	</p><p>

	<em>Nothing to lose</em>: Ericsson's core business is 
	telecommunications products, selling programming 
	tools is not really a business Ericsson	is interested in.
	</p><p>
	
	<em>Stimulate adoption</em>: Erlang is a great
	language for many sorts of systems. Releasing a 
	good, free development environment is likely to 
	make Erlang catch on faster.
	</p><p>

	<em>Generate goodwill</em>: Giving away cool software can
	only improve Ericsson's image, especially given the
	current level of media attention around "open software".
	</p><p>

</p></section>
<section><title>What can I do for Open Source Erlang?</title>
<p>

	Implement useful systems using Erlang. Spread the word!
	</p><p>

	Erlang is the easiest way to write fault-tolerant realtime software,
	but people won't use it if they don't know about it.
	</p><p>

	The more people we have using Erlang, the better quality
	the product becomes, the more cool applications we get
	and the more libraries are added to Erlang. Volunteers have
	already fixed several important bugs, created a 
	<url href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</url>
	package and ported Erlang to new platforms.
	</p><p>

</p></section>

<section><marker id="soft-realtime"/>
<title>What does soft realtime mean?</title>
<p>
        
	Cynics will say "basically nothing".
	</p><p>

	A <em>hard realtime</em>
	system is one which can guarantee that a certain action will
	always be carried out in less than a certain time. Many simple
	embedded systems can make hard realtime guarantees, e.g.
	it is possible to guarantee that a particular interrupt
	service routine on a Z80 CPU will never take more than 
	34us. It gets progressively harder to make such guarantees for
	more complex systems.
	</p><p>

	Many telecomms systems have less strict requirements, for 
	instance they might require a statistical guarantee 
	along the lines of "a database lookup takes less than 20ms 
	in 97% of cases". Soft realtime
	systems, such as Erlang, let you make that sort of guarantee.

	</p><p>
	A rule of thumb is that it is straightforward to write
	Erlang programs which can respond to 
	external events within a few milliseconds. 	
	The parts of Erlang which help with this are:
        </p>

	<list>
	<item><p>Language features which make it hard(er)
		for programmers to roughly estimate performance were
		never added to Erlang.
		For instance, Erlang doesn't have lazy evaluation.
		</p></item>

	<item><p>Erlang processes are very lightweight, much lighter
		than an operating system thread. Switching
		between Erlang processes is typically an order 
		of magnitude or two faster than switching between 
		OS threads.
		</p></item>

	<item><p>Each Erlang process is garbage collected separately.
		This avoids the (relatively) long delay which would
		occur if there was a single large heap for all
		processes.
		</p></item>

	</list>

<section><title> How did the first Erlang compiler get written?</title>
<p>

	(or: <em>how was Erlang bootstrapped?</em>) In Joe's words:
</p>
	<quote>
	<p>
	First I designed an abstract machine to execute Erlang.
	This was called the JAM machine; JAM = Joe's
	Abstract Machine.
	</p>
	</quote>
	
	<quote>
	<p>	
	Then I wrote a compiler from Erlang to JAM
	and an emulator to see if the machine worked.  
	Both these were written in prolog.
	</p>
	</quote>

	<quote>
	<p>
	At the same time Mike Williams wrote a C emulator for the JAM.
	</p>
	</quote>

	<quote>
	<p>
	Then I rewrote the erlang-to-jam compiler in Erlang and 
	used the prolog compiler to compile it. The resultant 
	object code was run in the C emulator. Then we threw away prolog.
	</p>	
        </quote>
<p>
	Some of this is described in <url 
           href="http://www.erlang.se/publications/prac_appl_prolog.ps">
	an old paper</url>

</p></section>
<section><title> Erlang Syntax and Semantics Details</title>
<p>

	When in doubt about exactly what the language allows or does, 
	the best place to start is the
	<url href="http://www.erlang.org/download/erl_spec47.ps.gz">
	Erlang Specification</url>. This is still a work
	in progress, but it covers most of the language.

</p></section>
<section><title> Is the order of message reception guaranteed?</title>
<p>

	Yes, but only within one process.
	</p><p>
	If there is a live process and you send it message A and then 
	message B, it's guaranteed that if message B arrived, message
	A arrived before it.
	</p><p>

	On the other hand, imagine processes P, Q and R. P sends 
	message A to Q, and then message B to R. There is no 
	guarantee that A arrives before B. (Distributed Erlang would
	have a pretty tough time if this was required!)
</p>

</section>
<section><title>If I send a message, is it guaranteed to reach the receiver?
</title>
<p>

	Most people find it simplest to program as though the answer
	was <em>"yes, always"</em>.
	</p><p>
	
	Per Hedeland covered the issues on the mailing list (edited a bit):
</p>
	
	<quote>
	<p>
	"Delivery is guaranteed if nothing breaks" - and if something 
	breaks, you will find
	out provided you've used <c>link/1</c>. I.e. 
	you will get an <c>EXIT</c> signal 
	not only if the linked process dies, but
	also if the entire remote node crashes, or the network is 
	broken, or if any of these happen <em>before</em> 
	you do the link.
	</p><p>
	
	It seems this issue of "guaranteed delivery" comes up every
	now and	then, but I've never managed to find out exactly what 
	it is those that are asking for it actually want:
        </p>
        </quote>

	<list>
	<item><p>	
		A guarantee that the message is put into the receiver's
		input queue? But if the receiver dies before extracting 
		it from there, that guarantee is useless, as the message 
		is lost anyway.
		</p></item>

	<item><p> A guarantee that the receiver extracts the message from its
		input queue? Well, besides the obvious problem that
		depending on how the receiver is written, even if 
		it lives happily ever after it may <em>never
		</em> extract 
		that particular message, it suffers from a variant of
	 	the previous problem: Even if you "know" that the 
		receiver has "consumed" the message, it may die before 
		acting on it in any way, and then again it may as well 
		never have been sent.
		</p></item>

	<item><p> A guarantee that the receiver actually 
		<em>processes</em>
		the message? Just kidding of course, hopefully it's 
		obvious to everyone that the only way to obtain such 
		a guarantee, regardless of what programming and
		communication system you use, is that the receiver 
		is programmed to send an explicit acknowledgment 
		when the processing is complete (of course this may 
		be hidden below an abstraction such as RPC, but the
		fundamental principle holds).
             </p></item>
	</list>

        <quote>	
        <p>
	Add to this that any guarantee would <em>have</em> 
	to entail some
	form of ack from the remote in at least a distributed
	system, even if it wasn't directly visible to the
	programmer. E.g. you could have '!' block until the ack
	comes back from the remote saying that the message had
	progressed however far you required - i.e. synchronous
	communication of sorts. But this would penalize those that
	<em>don't</em> require the "guarantee" and 
	<em>want</em> asynchronous communication.
	</p><p>

	So, depending on your requirements, Erlang offers you 
	<em>at least</em> these levels of "guarantee":
	</p>
        </quote>

	<section>
	<title>Super-safe</title>
        <p>

		Receiver sends ack after processing; 
		sender links, sends, waits for <c>ack</c>
		or <c>EXIT</c>.
		This means the sender knows, for each message, whether 
		it was fully processed or not.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section>
	<title>Medium-safe</title>
        <p>
		Receiver doesn't send acks; Sender links, 
		sends message(s). This means an <c>EXIT</c>
		signal informs the sender that some messages may never have
		been processed.
        </p>
        </section>
	
        <section>
	<title>Pretty-safe</title>
        <p>
		Receiver doesn't send acks; sender sends messages. :-)
        </p>
	</section>

        <quote>
        <p>
	There are any number of combinations of these (e.g. receiver sends
	ack not after each message but at some critical points in the 
	processing). 	
        </p>
	</quote>

<p>
	Per concluded by pointing out that "if you think TCP guarantees 
	delivery, which most people probably do, then so does Erlang".

</p></section>
<section><title> What limits does Erlang have?</title>
<p>

	The Erlang language doesn't specify any limits, but
	different implementations have different limits on the
	number of processes, the maximum amount of RAM and so on.
	These are 
	<url href="http://erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/advanced.html#9.2">documented for each implementation</url>.

</p></section>
<section><title>Do funs behave during a code change?</title>
<p>
	Yes and no. A fun is a reference to code; it is not the 
	code itself. Thus a fun can only be evaluated if the code
	it refers to is actually loaded on the evaluating node.
	
	In some cases, we can be sure that execution will never
	return to a fun. In these cases the old code can be purged 
	without	problems. The following code causes no surprises:
</p>
	
	<code><![CDATA[
	Parent = self(),
	F = fun() -> loop(Parent) end,
	spawn(F).
	]]></code>

<p>
	On the other hand, a bound fun will not be replaced.
	In the following example, the old verson of F is
	executed even after a code change:
</p>
	
<code><![CDATA[
	-module(cc).
	-export([go/0, loop/1]).

	go() ->
		F = fun() -> 5 end,
		spawn(fun() -> loop(F) end).

	loop(F) ->
		timer:sleep(1000), 
		F(),
		cc:loop(F).
]]></code>

<p>
	This type of problem can be solved in the 
	<c>code_change/2</c> function in the standard behaviours.

</p></section>
<section><title>Examples of bound funs causing surprises</title>
<p>
	Some typical ways to get in trouble are:
</p>

	<list>
	<item><p>Mnesia. If you store funs in mnesia, you need to 
		have a way to update the table (i.e. replace the
		fun references) when you load code.</p></item>

	<item><p>Serialisation. The same deal. If you serialise a
		fun (e.g. <c>term_to_binary/1</c>) and
		then unserialise it, you can only evaluate the fun
		if the code it refers to still exists. In general, 
		serialising a fun, saving it to a file and then
		loading it in another emulator will not do what you 
		hoped.</p></item>

	<item><p>Message passing. Sending a fun to a remote node
		always works, but the fun can only be evaluated on
		a node where the same version of the same module is
		available.</p></item>
	</list>
<p>
	A general way to avoid problems with funs which refer to code
	which doesn't exist is to store the function by name instead
	of by reference, e.g. by writing <c>fun M:F/A</c>.

</p></section>
<section><title>Is it just me, or are records ugly?</title>
<p>
	Compared to the rest of Erlang, records are rather 
	ugly and error prone. They're ugly because they 
	require an awful lot of typing (no pun intended).
	They're error prone because the usual method of defining
	records, the <c>-include</c> directive, 
	provides no protection against multiple, incompatible 
	definitions of records. 
	</p><p>

	Several ways forward have been explored. One is lisp-like
	<em>structs</em> which have been discussed on <url
	href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2003-January/006684.html">the
	mailing list.</url>

	Another is Richard O'Keefe's <em>abstract patterns</em> which
	is an <url
	href="http://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0029.html">Erlang Enhancement 
	Proposal</url>.

        Then there is also a suggestion for <url href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2005-September/017201.html">making records more reliable</url>.

    <marker id="priority-receive"/>
    <title>Can a process receive messages with varying priorities?</title>
<p>


        Sure. Here's an example of how to do it using nested receives:
</p>

        <code><![CDATA[
        receive ->
           {priority_msg, Data1} -> priority(Data1)
        after
           0 ->
             receive
        	{priority_msg, Data1} -> priority(Data1)
                {normal_msg, Data2} -> normal(Data2)
             end
        end.
        ]]></code>

<section><title>Flamewars</title>
<p>

	The following "questions" all relate to topics which have
	generated long discussions in public forums, often with
	some amount of stepping on people's toes. If you're going 
	to post a news article (or write a report, or...) about any 
	of these, reading the answers here might help you avoid 
	some arguments we've already been through.

</p></section>
<section><title>What's the history of static type checking in Erlang?</title>
<p>
        Current versions of Erlang (R12B onwards) ship with a static
	type analysis system called
	the <url href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/dialyzer/">Dialyzer</url>. Using
	the dialyzer is optional, though many or most serious projects
	use it. The Dialyzer does not require source code to be
	modified or annotated, though annotations increase the number
	of problems the Dialyzer can find.
</p>
<p>
	Until about 2005, static type checking was used rarely in 
	commercial Erlang-based systems. Several people experimented
	with various approaches to the problem, including Sven-Olof
	Nyström, Joe Armstrong, Philip Wadler, Simon Marlow and
	Thomas Arts.
</p>
</section>

<!-- This section is inspired by a post by ROK 23-Oct-2008 -->
<section><title>How does type checking in Erlang compare to
Java/Python/C/C++/Haskell?</title>
<p>
        Erlang itself, i.e. <em>ignoring</em> the Dialyzer, uses a
	dynamic type system. All type checking is done
	at run-time, the compiler does not check types at compile
	time. The run-time type system cannot be defeated. This is
	comparable to the type systems in Lisp, Smalltalk, Python,
	Javascript, Prolog and others.
</p>
<p>
        Java, Eiffel and some other languages have type systems which
	are mostly checked at compile time, but with some remaining
	checking done at run time. The combination of checking cannot
	be defeated. Such type systems provide some guarantees about
	types which can be exploited by the compiler, this can be
	useful for optimisation.
</p>
<p>
        Haskell, Mercury and some other languages have type systems
	which are completely checked at compile time. This type system
	cannot be defeated. The type system in this type of language
	is also a design tool, it increases the language's
	expressiveness.
</p>
<p>
        C, pascal and C++ have type systems which are checked at
	compile time, but can be defeated by straightforward means
	provided by the language.
</p>
</section>

<section><title>
Why do we have to have yet another programming language; C++ (or Java, 
or Visual Basic) does everything.
</title>
<p>

	It's undisputed that pretty much any programming language can
	do what every other language can, so in that sense Erlang is
	redundant.
	</p><p>
	
	On the other hand, we'd hope that some tools are better for
	some things than other tools. Erlang was born from systematic 
	experiments to determine what would make a language good
	at solving telecommunications-related problems, and 
	empirical evidence from	large projects within Ericsson 
	suggests that Erlang succeeded in doing that.
	</p><p>

</p></section>
<section><title>Erlang should use a Just In Time compiler</title>
<p>

	This might result in a faster Erlang system, or it might not.
	It would be interesting to see some research done in this
	area.

</p></section>
<section><title> Erlang should be object oriented</title>
<p>
	People coming to Erlang from object-oriented languages
	sometimes spend a while trying to write programs in an
	object-oriented style in Erlang before "seeing the light" and
	realising that the benefits that may give in other languages
	don't materialise in Erlang. Several papers have been
	published about how to "do OO in Erlang", including a chapter
	in the old (Armstrong, Virding, Wikström, Williams) Erlang
	book.
	</p><p>

	A common conservative position is to say that processes,
	asynchronous messages, functions and modules provide the 
	same ability to structure systems as do threads, classes, 
	methods, inheritance and aggregation.
	</p><p>

	An aggressive position is to say that OO is just
	snake oil, that inheritance is error prone and
	that any system which doesn't model concurrent problems
	with concurrency in the program is defective. Taking 
	this position in newsgroups/mailing lists tends to trigger 
	a flamewar.
	</p>

	<p>The <url href="http://ceylan.sourceforge.net/main/documentation/wooper/">
	    WOOPER</url> project is one example of a serious effort to
	  put an OO layer on top of Erlang. </p>
</section>
<section>
    <marker id="string-performance"/>
    <title>How are strings implemented and how can I speed up my string code?</title>
<p>
	Strings are represented as linked lists, so each character 
	takes 8 octets of memory on a 32 bit machine, twice as much on a 64
        bit machine. Access to the Nth element is O(N). This makes it 
        easy to accidentally write O(N^2) code. Here's an example of 
        how that can happen:
</p>

	<code><![CDATA[
	slurp(Socket) -> slurp(Socket, "").

	slurp(Socket, Acc) ->
	  case gen_tcp:recv(Socket, 1) of
	    {ok, [Byte]} -> slurp(Socket, Acc ++ Byte);
	    _ -> Acc
          end.
	]]></code>
	
<p>
	The bit-syntax provides an alternative way of handling 
	strings with different space/time tradeoffs to the
	list implementation.
</p>

        <p>Some techniques for improving performance of string-related
        code:
</p>
	
	<list>
	<item><p>Avoid O(N^2) operations. Sometimes this means building
		a longer string backwards and then using <c>reverse
		</c>
		in the final step. Other times, it's better to build
		up a string as a list of lists and then let the io
		functions flatten the list.
		</p></item>

        <item><p>Consider using an alternative representation of
                your data, e.g. instead of representing the text as a 
                list of characters, it may be better to represent it as
                a tree of words.
		</p></item>

	<item><p>If you're reading and writing data from sockets, 
		consider using binaries instead of lists of bytes. If 
		all you're doing is copying data from one socket to 
		another, this will be (much) faster. More generally,
                the bit-syntax provides an alternative way of handling
                strings with different space/time tradeoffs to the list
                implementation.

		</p></item>

	<item><p>Write speed-critical (profile first!) code in C, 
		and then put it in your erlang system as a port-driver or a 
		linked-in driver.
		</p></item>

	<item><p>Ports (and sockets) flatten lists for you, 
		so flattening lists yourself slows things down. 
		This can also be used to create more readable code:
              </p>
<code><![CDATA[
gen_tcp:send(Socket, ["GET ", Url, " HTTP/1.0", "\r\n\r\n"]).

</section>
<section><title> How does the Garbage Collector work?</title>
<p>
	The current default GC is a "stop the world" generational
	mark-sweep collector. Each Erlang process has its
	own heap and these are collected individually, so
	although every process is stopped while GC happens
	for one processes, this stop time is expected to
	be short because each process is expected to have a 
	small heap.
	</p><p>

	The GC for a new process is full-sweep. Once the process'
	live data grows above a certain size, the GC switches to 
	a generational strategy. If the generational strategy
	reclaims less than a certain amount, the GC reverts
	to a full sweep. If the full sweep also fails to recover
	enough space, then the heap size is increased. 
	</p><p>

	In practice, this works quite well. It scales well
	because larger systems tend to have more processes
	rather than (just) larger processes. Measurements
	in AXD301 (the large ATM switch) showed that about
	5% of CPU time is spent garbage collecting.
	</p><p>

	Problems arise when the assumptions are violated,
	e.g. having processes with rapidly growing large heaps.

	</p><p>
	There are some alternative approaches to memory management
	which can be enabled at run-time, including a <em>shared
	heap</em>.
	

</p></section>
<section><title>Can I exploit knowledge about my program to make the GC more efficient?</title>
<p>
	Maybe, but you might be better off expending effort on
	thinking of other ways to make your system go faster. 
	</p><p>

	One version of <c>spawn/4</c> accepts a list of
	options as the last argument. Ulf Wiger (AXD301) says
	that the <c>gc_switch</c> and <c>min_heap_size</c> can be
	used to obtain better performance if you do some measuring,
	benchmarking and thinking. One 'win' happens when you can
	completely avoid GC in short-lived processes by setting their
	initial heap large enough to avoid all GC during the
	process' life.
	</p><p>

	<c>min_heap_size</c> can be useful when you <em>know</em> that a
	certain process will rapidly grow its heap to well above
	the system's default size. Under such circumstances you get
	particularly bad GC performance with the current GC 
	implementation.
	</p><p>

	<c>gc_switch</c> affects the point at 
	which the garbage collector
	changes from its full-sweep algorithm to its generational
	algorithm. Again, in a rapidly growing heap which doesn't
	contain many binaries, GC <em>might</em> perform 
	better with a higher threshold.
	</p><p>

	Yes.</p>

	<p><url href='http://www.erjang.org/'>Erjang</url> does exactly
	that. It's an experimental system with some impressive results.

<section><title>Is it possible to prove the correctness of Erlang programs?
</title>
<p>

	One of the touted advantages of functional programming
	languages is that it is easier to formally reason about
	programs and prove certain properties of a given program.
	</p><p>

	There is an active research group looking at problems
	related to formal verification, they have a

<section><title>I've heard it's a bad idea to program defensively in Erlang. Why?</title>

<p>
	The <url href="http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml">
	Erlang coding guidelines</url> suggest avoiding defensive 
	programming. The choice of the term "defensive programming" 
	is unfortunate, because it is usually associated with good
	practice. The point of the recommendation is that allowing
	an Erlang process to exit when things go wrong inside the
	Erlang program is a <em>good</em> approach, i.e. 
	writing code which attempts to avoid an exit is usually a bad idea.
</p><p>
	For example, when parsing an integer it makes perfect 
	sense to just write
</p>

	<code><![CDATA[
	I = list_to_integer(L)
	]]></code>
<p>
	if L is not an integer, the process will exit and a supervisor 
	somewhere will restart that part of the system, reporting an
	error:
</p>

	<code><![CDATA[
	=ERROR REPORT==== 12-Mar-2003::13:04:08 ===
	Error in process <0.25.0> with exit value: {badarg,[{erlang,list_to_integer,[bla]},{erl_eval,expr,3},{erl_eval,exprs,4},{shell,eval_loop,2}]}
** exited: {badarg,[{erlang,list_to_integer,[bla]},
                    {erl_eval,expr,3},
                    {erl_eval,exprs,4},
                    {shell,eval_loop,2}]} **

	]]></code>

<p>
	If a more descriptive diagnostic is required, use a manual exit:
</p>

	<code><![CDATA[
	uppercase_ascii(C) when C >= $a, C =< $z ->
          C - ($a - $A);
        uppercase_ascii(X) -> 
          exit({"uppercase_ascii given non-lowercase argument", X}).
	]]></code>
<p>
	This separation of error detection and error handling is a key
	part of Erlang. It reduces complexity in fault-tolerant systems
	by keeping the normal and error-handling code separate.
</p><p>
	As for most most advice, there are exceptions to the recommendation. One
	example is the case where input is coming from an untrusted
	interface, e.g. a user or an external program.
